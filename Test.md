2. The TC attempted to account for uneven sampling by relativizing fitness parameters within each population.
=============================================================================================================

Lets define the haplotype frequency of isolate X in Population "a" as Y<sub>xa</sub>, which is estimated by counting the number of isolates X and dividing by the total count of all isolates in population a:

Y<sub>xa</sub> = count of isolate X / count of all isolates in population a

or Y<sub>xa</sub> = X<sub>i</sub> / X<sub>a</sub>

Let's define Y<sub>a as the mean strain frequency in Population "a", estimated as the sum of the haplotype frequencies of all isolates found in population A divided by the count of all isolates in population "a"

Y<sub>a</sub> = ∑X</sub>i</sub> / X<sub>a</sub>

Now if we were to estimate the relative fitness of haplotype X as Frederickson propose, the estimate would be based in the following equation where the haplotype frequency of isolate X in Population "a" would be divided by the mean haplotype frequency in Population "a" (i.e. Y<sub>a</sub>):

Y<sub>xa</sub> = (X</sub>i</sub>) / (X<sub>a</sub>/Y<sub>a</sub> , resolving this equation we would have the following:

Y<sub>xa</sub> = (X<sub>i</sub> / X<sub>a</sub>) / ∑X</sub>i</sub> / X<sub>a</sub>

To resolve this equation we have a division with a common denominator, and ultimately what we resolve is our original equation:

Y<sub>xa</sub> = X</sub>i</sub> / X<sub>a</sub>
