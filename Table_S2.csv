"Table S2 Table of all isolates included in analyses and associated accession numbers. Isolate name includes collection year (2005 = 05), collection host plant (LoS = Lotus strigosus), and plant number followed by nodule number isolate was cultured from (1_2 = plant 1, nodule 2). Within locus haplotypes also defined such that all isolates with the same R01 designation have exactly the same sequenced recAloci. Chromosome (CHR) and symbiosis island (SI)  haplotypes are concatenations of the appropriate loci. Xs indicate loci that failed to amplify and/or sequence properly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
