# Selection-For-Cheating

A technical comment, hereafter TC (Frederickson 2019), proposed that the negative association between strain frequency and host-growth benefits is an artifact of uneven population sampling, stating that “highly unequal sampling results in differences in mean strain frequency among the six study populations.” However, Frederickson’s analyses included sampling and mathematical errors, and rarefaction approaches that we view as overly conservative. 

This repository was created to show the detailed code in response to TC here. Please refer to the file  	"A.response.to.Frederickson.md" to see the code.
